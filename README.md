## Results

![filter]()


## Summary

One of the drawback of this webpage is the similar color for the placeholder. It is hard to distiguish the between the entered value and example value. I  would change the font color in the css file.

```
input {
    color: black !important;
}

::placeholder {
    color:lightgray !important;
}
````


- Before
![before]()

-After
![after]()
